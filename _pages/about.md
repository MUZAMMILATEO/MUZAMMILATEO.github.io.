## Welcome

I am **Muzammil Khan**, a Postdoctoral Researcher in the **Robotics and Mechatronics (RaM) Group at the University of Twente**, The Netherlands. My work is situated at the interface of **Computer Vision, Artificial Intelligence, and Medical Robotics**, with particular interests in:

- Visual SLAM and monocular reconstruction for minimally invasive surgery  
- Generative and explainable AI in healthcare  
- Deep learning for medical image segmentation and tumour detection  
- Robotics-assisted cancer treatment and surgical navigation  

I completed my PhD in Computer Vision and Machine Learning, where my research centred on **optical flow estimation** and its applications to 3D scene understanding.
