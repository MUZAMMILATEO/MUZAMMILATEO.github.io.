**Motion estimation** from video sequences is essential for numerous real-world applications, including **surveillance, traffic monitoring, fire detection, weather prediction, and medical imaging**. Optical flow is a widely used representation for such motion, but existing methods often fail to produce **dense, robust, and discontinuity-preserving flow fields**.  

This paper introduces a **nonlinear fractional-order variational model** for optical flow estimation that extends classical integer-order methods to fractional order \((0,1)\). The model integrates:  

- A **Charbonnier norm-based data term**, ensuring robustness against noise and outliers.  
- A **Caputo fractional derivative-based regularisation**, which preserves discontinuities, captures long-term memory effects, and allows adaptive fractional-order tuning for stability.  
- **Numerical discretisation** via the **Grünwald–Letnikov scheme**, solved using a **multi-variable fixed-point iteration strategy** embedded in a **coarse-to-fine warping framework** for global optimisation.  

Experiments conducted across **20 diverse application-oriented datasets** (including fire, smoke, fluids, chest X-rays, and synthetic benchmarks) show that the proposed framework produces **robust, edge-preserving optical flow**, outperforming existing models. Results are validated through multiple error metrics, **_3D_ error histograms**, intensity-based edge preservation analysis, and convergence studies.
