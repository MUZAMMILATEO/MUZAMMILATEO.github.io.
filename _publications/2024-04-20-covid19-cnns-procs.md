**COVID-19** severely impacts the respiratory system, with characteristic **pulmonary lesions and consolidations** detectable via **CXR (X-ray) and CT imaging**. Manual interpretation, however, requires significant expertise and resources, motivating the use of deep learning methods.  

This study presents a **comparative analysis of convolutional neural network (CNN) models** for COVID-19 detection, focusing on transfer learning combined with traditional machine learning classifiers. Specifically:  

- Four widely used CNN feature extractors are paired with **five distinct classifiers**, forming multiple hybrid architectures.  
- Models are trained and tested separately on **CXR and CT datasets**, with performance evaluated using diverse metrics.  
- **Inception V3 with a neural network classifier** achieves the highest classification accuracy \\((91.18%)\\) on CXR images.  

The work also includes a **comparative study with existing frameworks**, demonstrating where transfer learning models provide significant advantages for **automated, early COVID-19 diagnosis**.
