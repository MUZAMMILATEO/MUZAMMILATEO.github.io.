**Bladder tumours (BTs)** pose significant clinical challenges due to their high recurrence rates and risk of progression to invasive malignancies, underscoring the need for **early and accurate detection**. **Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI)**, with its superior soft tissue contrast, is a promising modality for BT detection. To analyse MRI scans, artificial intelligence (AI) models are increasingly being adopted; however, they are often constrained by **limited annotated datasets**, challenges in **pixel-level tumour prediction**, and **insufficient transparency** in outputs.

This study introduces the **Explainable and Likelihood-Aware AI (ELAAI) framework**, designed to address these limitations. Trained solely on annotated normal bladder MRI scans, ELAAI integrates three novel modules:  
- **MFA-Net**, a multi-scale feature aggregation network for robust bladder segmentation.  
- **Adaptive tolerance refinement**, enhancing segmentation of irregularities.  
- **SLIP-Net**, a vision transformer with a multi-scale deterministic uncertainty (MSDU) head for tumour likelihood prediction.  

Extensive evaluations against state-of-the-art (SOTA) methods demonstrate ELAAI’s **superior segmentation accuracy**, **uncertainty-aware tumour prediction**, and **enhanced transparency**, contributing to **greater reliability and trust in AI-assisted clinical decision-making**.
