This study introduces a **nonlinear fractional-order variational (NFOV) model** for **optical flow estimation**, extending classical integer-order formulations. The model is designed to achieve **robustness against outliers** while maintaining **dense and discontinuity-preserving flow fields**.  

Key aspects of the NFOV model include:  

- A **non-quadratic Charbonnier norm-based data term**, which enhances resilience against noise and outliers.  
- A **Marchaud fractional derivative-based regularisation term**, whose non-local nature effectively preserves textures and discontinuous edges.  
- **Numerical discretisation** using the **Grünwald–Letnikov fractional derivative**, followed by an outer fixed-point iteration scheme to linearise the nonlinear system.  

The resulting formulation is solved efficiently with iterative numerical methods. Experiments conducted on a variety of benchmark datasets demonstrate the NFOV model’s **accuracy, robustness, and superiority over state-of-the-art optical flow approaches**.
