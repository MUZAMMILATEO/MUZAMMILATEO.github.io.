This work introduces a **hybrid framework** for detecting COVID-19 from **chest X-ray (CXR) images**, integrating **deep learning with variational optical flow modelling**. The proposed method combines:  

- **Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)** for feature extraction and classification of CXR images.  
- A **segmentation-based fractional-order optical flow model** to capture fine structural and intensity variations.  
- A hybrid pipeline that leverages both data-driven learning and mathematically grounded modelling to improve robustness.  

The study demonstrates that even with a **limited dataset of 128 CXRs (64 COVID-19, 64 normal)**, the hybrid model achieves strong classification accuracy, while addressing **overfitting**.    

This paper contributes to the growing body of research on **AI-assisted medical imaging for pandemic response**, emphasising the potential of hybrid models that balance **data-driven and model-based approaches**.
