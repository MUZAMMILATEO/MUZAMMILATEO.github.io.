**Motion estimation** in video sequences is central to computer vision applications, yet traditional integer-order variational models often struggle with robustness and discontinuity handling.  

This paper introduces a **fractional-order variational model** for optical flow estimation, leveraging:  

- The **Charbonnier norm** as a robust, non-quadratic penalty term, generalisable to the L1-norm.  
- The **Marchaud fractional derivative**, which captures non-local information and effectively handles **discontinuous textures and edges**.  
- **Numerical discretisation** using the **Grünwald–Letnikov scheme**, with the nonlinear formulation reduced to a solvable linear system.  

Experiments across diverse datasets demonstrate that the proposed model yields **dense, robust, and edge-preserving optical flow fields**, even under noise. Comparisons with recent approaches further validate its **accuracy and stability**.
