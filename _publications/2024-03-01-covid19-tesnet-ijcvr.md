**COVID-19** severely affects the respiratory system, leading to **high fatality rates** if not detected early. Medical imaging, particularly **chest X-rays (CXR)** and **computed tomography (CT)**, provides a non-invasive and cost-effective way to identify COVID-19.  

This paper introduces **TES-Net**, a **novel convolutional neural network (CNN) framework** for COVID-19 detection that combines:  

- **Transfer learning**, leveraging pre-trained networks to address limited dataset availability.  
- **Ensemble learning**, integrating multiple models to achieve higher predictive accuracy.  
- **Skip connections**, mitigating the problem of vanishing gradients and improving deep network performance.  

The framework is rigorously validated on **CXR and CT datasets**, with performance reported using multiple evaluation metrics. Comparative studies demonstrate that **TES-Net outperforms existing CNNs and conventional machine learning classifiers**. An **ablation study** further highlights the contribution of each component, establishing the robustness and interpretability of the proposed architecture.
