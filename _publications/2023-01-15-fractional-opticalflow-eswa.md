**Motion estimation** is a fundamental problem in computer vision with applications in **object detection, video surveillance, undersea navigation, fire analysis, medical imaging, and fluid dynamics**. Conventional optical flow methods, however, struggle with **outliers**, **discontinuities**, and **complex textures**.  

This study proposes a **nonlinear fractional-order variational model** for motion estimation using **optical flow**, generalising classical integer-order formulations. Key features include:  

- A **level set segmentation-based fractional variational functional**, applied directly to the **flow field** rather than images.  
- A **non-quadratic Charbonnier penalty**, improving robustness against noise and outliers.  
- **Fractional derivatives** with non-local properties, enabling accurate handling of textures and edge discontinuities.  
- Efficient **numerical discretisation** via the **Grünwald–Letnikov scheme**, converting nonlinear PDEs into a tractable linear system.  

The framework was evaluated across **10 diverse spectra** (synthetic, Sintel, thermal, underwater, medical, fire, smoke, and fluid datasets). Results demonstrate **dense, discontinuity-preserving optical flow** with superior robustness and accuracy compared to state-of-the-art models.
